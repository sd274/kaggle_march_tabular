# Kaggle March Tab Comp

Building up a bit of a framework that can be used to better organise kaggle competitions. 

Ideas is that models are wrapped up the `TabularModelConfigBase` class. This class will then handle the training, validation and logging of the models. So that experiment progress can be logged and tracked.

In order to use this repo you will need to download the kaggle data and include in your local copy.
